# Data Crawler for Beauty Cosmetic and Personal Care Retailers

## Project Description

This project aims to gather data from top local online retailers in the beauty cosmetic and personal care industry. The collected data will be stored in a database and utilized by analysts and market researchers to gain insights into the competitive landscape, consumer preferences, pricing strategies, and product development opportunities.

## Objectives

1. **Market Analysis**: Identify popular brands, trending products, and pricing strategies to gain a comprehensive understanding of the competitive landscape in the beauty cosmetic and personal care industry.

2. **Consumer Preferences**: Analyse collected data to understand the preferences, needs, and sentiments of Hong Kong consumers. These insights will inform product development and marketing strategies to better cater to consumer demands.

3. **Pricing Strategy**: Determine optimal pricing strategies by evaluating price competitiveness and making informed decisions regarding discounts and promotions. This analysis will help maximize sales and profitability in the market.

4. **Product Development**: Utilise  ingredient information obtained from the data crawler to align product development efforts with market demands and trends. This will ensure that the developed products resonate with the target audience and have a competitive edge.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure that the required dependencies are installed. The project may have separate Python notebooks for crawling data from the index page, detailed page, and different websites. Make sure to have the necessary tools, such as Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, installed to run these notebooks.

4. Run the appropriate Python notebooks for crawling data from the desired sources. Each notebook will generate CSV files containing the scraped data.

5. Manually import the generated CSV files into your desired database. This can be done using tools or commands specific to your database system.

6. Once the data is collected, analysts and market researchers can utilize the stored data for market analysis, consumer preference analysis, pricing strategy evaluation, and product development.

7. Refer to the documentation and code comments for detailed explanations of the implementation and data analysis processes.
